        HeLLin is a simple wave-based pixel-art shooter game created by small gamed studio.<br>
The player takes on the role of a rambo-commander character. The goal of this game is to survive as long as possible among a huge amount of enemies.<br>It's a simple game at first, but the further into the forest the harder it gets and it gives a lot of fun from the beginning.<br>Here you can find out how it all came about.

      <div class="section1-content">
        First thing is a concept/idea for a game. HeLLin was supposed to be dynamic, simple and good-looking game. <br>We decided to make something like Mario Bros and Karlson The Game by Dani. <br>Therefore many platforms and a lot of easy enemies in a short period of time. <br>We divided the game into waves, where every next wave has more enemies.

      <div class="section2-content">
        Our goal in make HeLLin was to create easy in art, good looking game with well levels, enemies, commander and light. <br>
Enemies are a small easy to win happy devils. <br>
Locations change during the game from devil’s library to neon China’s town by mountains, forest, graveyard, ship deck and spaceship.<br>
At some levels the light is dim, while others are even glowing.

      <div class="section3-content">
        Enemies are creature, which finding the best and shortest way to current position of player commando.<br>
And it was our the biggest problem. <br>
It was our first time with something like this, so we encounter with many, many bugs and stupid behaviors, like enemies stacking or spawn on / too near player.<br>
AI in HeLLin was completed at the end and we worked on in the longest.

        After some work, when we had firsts script, AI and levels, time at sounds had come.<br> 
We had to prepare the appropriate music theme, sounds and sfxs. <br>
Music theme had to be once for all levels and game.<br>
Every heart-loss, kill and death must had own sounds.<br>
It was very hard to pair it with others elements, but finally we made it.

Finally, after 3 weeks, we published it and felt great reefiest and joy.
